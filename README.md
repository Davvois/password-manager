# Password Manager
This is a simple password manager written by me,<br>
I hope this founds out useful for you :)
<h3> (This needs to be updated still) </h3>

# Setup
Run the code in the same directory as the "main.py" file, <br>
download also the "passwords.txt" file and put it also in the same directory. <br><br>

Once you've done this, run the code and enjoy!
